#Learning Journal Day 7

Today we learned about constuctor functions and how to utilize them.  The amount of lines that I was able to cut out of my code was incredible!

Today went a lot smoother than yesterday, as I had a better understanding of functions and how they are structured. I still had to get a good amount of help with my code, but I was able to talk my way through some things and the day just felt better overall.
