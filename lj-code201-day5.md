#Learning Journal Day 5

####Today was a day full of highs and lows. Coming out of lecture, I felt overwhelmed by everything that we had learned and ended up forgetting how to even creat a repo and add it to my computer via the terminal.

####After figuring that out, I got through the second qustion of the lab fin, but the third one stumped both me and Kaylyn as we tried to work together to get through it.  With the help of our wonderful instructors, we were eventually able to figure out how to structure our code without using a + or * to get the desired results.

####Question 4 was the high point of the day, because with the knowledge of how to do the previous questions, I was able to figure how to structure the function to call the sum of an array plus a string. It was a very gratifying experience!
