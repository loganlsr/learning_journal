#Learning Journal Day 12
Today went a lot smoother than Monday.  I got everything to work!  I ran into an issue that took Nadia, Nick and I a while to figure out. I was having an issue with images still repeating on consecutive sets, and it turned out that I was calling the function that made my images one too many times which was what caused that doubleing up. It was doing everything correctly and would have no dupes in the next set, but I would override that with new images that contained images from the set that was two iterations back, making it look like there were dupes.
