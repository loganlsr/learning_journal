#Learning Journal Day 8

Font is important!  I need to do some research and dig deep into fonts and applying them in design.
Designers want to work with people who can accurately implement designs in web development.

Worked in pairs today and I got paired up with David. He was way more knowledgable and intuitive when it came to implementing the codet that we both needed to use to finish the assignment today.
