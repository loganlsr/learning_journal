#LJ Code 201 Day 3

Today was an interesting day.  We utilized when, if, and for loops, and it was certainly challenging!  I encountered a weird bug in my project today where the loop on my question 7 was repeating one time too many. We fixed it by subtracting 1 from my states.length, but Brian said that that was just a shot in the dark when he suggested it!
