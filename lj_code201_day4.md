# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

## Today we wrapped our About_Me javascript in functions and I got to experience a lengthy debugging process during my paired programming time with Kaylyn.

## It was interesting to see how code with a few bugs can get completely broken when you add another element. it was also cool to see the different ways that people go about debugging and repairing code!
