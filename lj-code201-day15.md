#Learning Journal Day 15
Today was a really interesting day.  Our groups got formed for the group assignment, and after getting all of our work done, and watching 301 presentations, we spent a good 3-4 hours going over how we want our site to be used, how we want it to look, and how we want it to function. 

We didn't touch code at all, but just mapped out our project. It felt very business like, and I imagine that I will have a lot of experiences like this when I get a job in the field.
