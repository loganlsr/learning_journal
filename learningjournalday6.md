#Learning Journal Day 6

Today we used functions to make data appear on a web page.

It was really hard and frustrating trying to work out the functions needed to make that work with little prior knowledge. I've discovered that I'm not very intuitive when it comes to those kinds of things. When someone shows me how to do something, I can usually figure out how to do it again, but starting from scratch with little to no knowledge on how to do something makes doing something almost impossible for me.

With help from Nick, Sam, and Nadia, I was able to get things figured out eventually.
